# Team Decision Log

Update this with key decisions your team makes that you need to remember. The entries in this table are only examples. You may add, change, or delete these based on the needs of your team.

To set this up, add each teammate's name in the `Teammate Name` column. Each team member should place an 'X' under their name to vote for the ideas they like the best.
